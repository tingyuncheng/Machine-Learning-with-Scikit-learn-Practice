# Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-learn-Practice

This repository is the note I worked on during my free time to enhance my machine learning knowledge, including supervised and unsupervised machine learning. I follow along the skills and knowledge taught in a course, Machine Learning 101 with Scikit-learn and StatsModels, and refer to the Scikit-learn website for codes to access the model performance and more. Generally, this course and its materials help me review and restructure my machine learning knowledge and intrigue me to keep learning using Python. <br>

There are three parts of this repository: <br>
1) Supervised Machine Learning (Predict a continuous target variable using Linear Regression model)<br>
2) Supervised Machine Learning (Predict a binary classification target variable using Logistic Regression model)<br>
3) Unsupervised Machine Learning (Conduct a market segmentation using K-means) <br>
