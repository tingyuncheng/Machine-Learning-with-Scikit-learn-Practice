# Machine-Learning-with-Scikit-learn-Practice

This repository is the summary and comments I worked on during my free time for the basic machine learning knowledge, including supervised machine learning such as linear regression, logistic regression, and unsupervised ML like cluster analysis. I follow along the skills and knowledge taught in this course, Machine Learning 101 with Scikit-learn and StatsModels, and refer to the Scikit-learn website for codes to access the model performance and more. Generally, this course and materials help me review and restructure my machine learning knowledge, and intrigue me to keep learning using Python. <br>
